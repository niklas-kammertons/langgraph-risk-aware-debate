I recently purchased the 'Signature Canvas Backpack' from your boutique, but I am extremely disappointed. In the showroom it looked perfect, but when the sun shines on it outdoors, the color looks completely different—it has a yellowish tint that wasn't visible under the boutique lights. 

For a $600 luxury item, this is unacceptable. I demand a full refund immediately. I am a long-time VIP customer and expect this to be resolved today without me having to drive back to the store.
